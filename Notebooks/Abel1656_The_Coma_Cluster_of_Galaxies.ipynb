    "# Abell 1656: the Coma Cluster of Galaxies\n",
    "This notebook is based on the EURO-VO tutorial: \"Abell 1656: The Coma Cluster of Galaxies\" (http://www.euro-vo.org/?q=science/scientific-tutorials) by Massimo Ramella & Giulia Iafrate (INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste). The tutorial was later updated by Caroline Bot, Thomas Boch, Jenny G. Sorce and Katharina A. Lutz (all CDS, CNRS, Observatoire astronomique de Strasbourg). This notebook by Katharina A. Lutz, Thomas Boch, Matthieu Bauman and Ana Nebot (all CDS, CNRS, Observatoire astronomique de Strasbourg) shows how to perform the tasks of the original tutorial from within a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goals of this notebook tutorial are:\n",
    " - Examine the Coma cluster of galaxies (Abell 1656) using services and data from the virtual observatory withinin a jupyter notebook in order to perform a quick evaluation of the mean redshift and velocity dispersion of the cluster. Both measurements are important to study the evolution of galaxy clusters. To do so we use redshifts and photometry (Petrosian r magnitude) from the SDSS survey and then add redshifts from the CAIRNS survey (Rines et al. 2003) in order to improve the completeness of the redshift sample.\n",
    " - Search the MAST archive for HST spectra in the region of the Coma cluster.\n",
    " - Download a spectrum from MAST and do a quick analysis of the redshift of the emission lines in the spectrum. \n",
    " \n",
    "For our analysis we need to following python packages: astropy (3.2.1) and the affiliated packages astroquery (0.3.10.dev), specutils(0.5.2), and pyvo (0.9.3), as well as ipyaladin (0.1.6), matplotlib (3.1.1), seaborn (0.9.0) and numpy (1.17.0). All packages can be installed via\n",

    "    pip install [package name]\n",
    "    \n",
    "The warning package will only be in use until the pyvo team has removed an astropy deprecation warning.  "
