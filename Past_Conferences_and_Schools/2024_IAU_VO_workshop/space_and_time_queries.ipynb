    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS)**: HiPS describes a generic method for packaging, storing, querying, and describing astronomical data. It stores data in a folder structure that mimics the [HEALPix tesselation of the sky](https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/pdf/intro.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Order Coverage (MOC)**: MOC is a data structure used to describe arbitrary regions of the sky with variable resolution. It is particularly useful for handling large-scale astronomical surveys and for efficiently querying regions of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space-Time MOC (STMOC)**: STMOC extends the concept of MOC to include the temporal dimension, allowing for the representation of regions of the sky that change over time. This is useful for time-domain astronomy, where the visibility of sources varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic and mysterious phenomena in the universe. These brief but intense flashes of gamma rays are believed to originate from cataclysmic events such as the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars. Observing GRBs across multiple wavelengths and with different telescopes provides crucial insights into their nature and origins. In this study, we focus on GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory, and demonstrate how the use of Space-Time Multi-Order Coverage (STMOC) can help identify and analyze these fascinating events.\n",

There was a peak of gamma and X-ray emission 25 seconds after the event was first detected, followed by a somewhat smaller peak 40 seconds after the beginning of the event. The emission then fizzled out in a series of small peaks over the next 50 seconds, and eight minutes after the event had faded to a hundredth of its maximum brightness. The burst was so strong that it ranked in the top 2% of all bursts detected.\n",

    "Astronomer Mark Metzger determined that GRB 970508 occurred at least 6 billion light years from Earth; this was the first measurement of the distance to a gamma-ray burst. Until this burst, astronomers had not reached a consensus regarding how far away GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate.\n",

    "By now we have seen the power of using STMOCs to identify transients events such as GRBs. This method can also be applied for different short-lived or transient astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants which emit at different wavelengths, motion of bodies from within our solar system, gravitational events... STMOCs is a powerful tool which facilitates the identification of temporal and spatial overlaps, enabling comprehensive multi-wavelength analyses and efficient data management, ultimately advancing our understanding of the objects of interest."
