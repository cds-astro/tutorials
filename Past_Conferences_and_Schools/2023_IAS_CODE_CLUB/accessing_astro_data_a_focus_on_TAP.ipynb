       "<tr><td>A toy model for gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB SNe) is discussed by considering the coexistence of baryon-poor outflows from black holes (BHs) and a powerful spin connection to the surrounding disk, giving rise to consistent calorimetry as described by van Putten in a variant of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process. In this model the half-opening angle of the magnetic flux tube on the horizon is determined by the mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the BH horizon and the radial coordinate on the surrounding accretion disk. The GRB is powered by the baryon-poor outflows in the BZ process, and the associated SN is powered by a very small fraction of the spin energy transferred from the BH to the disk in the magnetic coupling process. The timescale of the GRB is fitted by the duration of the open magnetic flux on the horizon. It turns out that the data of several GRB SNe are well fitted with our model.</td><td>2005ApJ...619..420L</td><td>10.1086/426378</td><td>ApJ</td><td>426</td><td>6</td><td>185306</td><td>420</td><td>A toy model for gamma-ray bursts in type Ib/c supernovae.</td><td>619</td><td>2005</td></tr>\n",
       "<tr><td>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide us with a unique tool for measuring extragalactic distances and determining cosmological parameters. As a result, the precise and effective calibration for peak luminosities of SNe Ia becomes extremely crucial and thus is critically scrutinized for cosmological explorations. In this Letter, we reveal clear evidence for a tight linear correlation between peak luminosities of SNe Ia and their B-V colors ~12 days after the {\\em B} maximum denoted by {Delta}C_12_. By introducing such a novel color parameter, {Delta}C_12_, this empirical correlation allows us to uniformly standardize SNe Ia with decline rates {Delta}m_15_in the range of 0.8&lt;{Delta}m_15_&lt;2.0 and to reduce scatters in estimating their peak luminosities from ~0.5 mag to the levels of 0.18 and 0.12 mag in the {\\em V} and {\\em I} bands, respectively. For a sample of SNe Ia with insignificant reddenings of host galaxies [e.g., E(B-V)_host_{&lt;~}0.06 mag], the scatter drops further to only 0.07 mag (or 3%-4% in distance), which is comparable to observational accuracies and is better than other calibrations for SNe Ia. This would impact observational and theoretical studies of SNe Ia and cosmological scales and parameters.</td><td>2005ApJ...620L..87W</td><td>10.1086/428774</td><td>ApJ</td><td>90</td><td>10</td><td>185402</td><td>87</td><td>A novel color parameter as a luminosity calibrator for type Ia supernovae.</td><td>620</td><td>2005</td></tr>\n",
       "<tr><td>We have analyzed the magnetic effects that may occur in rapidly rotating core collapse supernovae. We consider effects from both magnetic turbulence and the formation of magnetic bubbles. For magnetic turbulence we have made a perturbative analysis for our spherically symmetric, core-collapse supernova model that incorporates the buildup of magnetic field energy in the matter accreting onto the proto-neutron star shortly after collapse and bounce. This significantly modifies the pressure profile and increases the heating of the material above the proto-neutron star resulting in an explosion even in rotating stars that would not explode otherwise. Regarding magnetic bubbles, we show that a model with an initial uniform magnetic field ~10^8^ G and uniform angular velocity of ~0.1 rad/s can form magnetic bubbles due to the very nonhomologous nature of the collapse. It is estimated that the buoyancy of the bubbles causes matter in the proto-neutron star to rise, carrying neutrino-rich material to the neutron star surface. This increases the neutrino luminosity sufficiently at early times to achieve a successful neutrino-driven explosion. Both magnetic mechanisms thus provide new means for initiating a Type II core-collapse supernova.</td><td>2005ApJ...628..335W</td><td>10.1086/430297</td><td>ApJ</td><td>342</td><td>0</td><td>186544</td><td>335</td><td>On rapidly rotating magnetic core-collapse supernovae.</td><td>628</td><td>2005</td></tr>\n",

In this model the half-opening angle of the magnetic flux tube on the horizon is determined by the mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the BH horizon and the radial coordinate on the surrounding accretion disk. The GRB is powered by the baryon-poor outflows in the BZ process, and the associated SN is powered by a very small fraction of the spin energy transferred from the BH to the disk in the magnetic coupling process. The timescale of the GRB is fitted by the duration of the open magnetic flux on the horizon. It turns out that the data of several GRB SNe are well fitted with our model. ...\n",
       "                    Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide us with a unique tool for measuring extragalactic distances and determining cosmological parameters. As a result, the precise and effective calibration for peak luminosities of SNe Ia becomes extremely crucial and thus is critically scrutinized for cosmological explorations. In this Letter, we reveal clear evidence for a tight linear correlation between peak luminosities of SNe Ia and their B-V colors ~12 days after the {\\em B} maximum denoted by {Delta}C_12_. By introducing such a novel color parameter, {Delta}C_12_, this empirical correlation allows us to uniformly standardize SNe Ia with decline rates {Delta}m_15_in the range of 0.8<{Delta}m_15_<2.0 and to reduce scatters in estimating their peak luminosities from ~0.5 mag to the levels of 0.18 and 0.12 mag in the {\\em V} and {\\em I} bands, respectively. For a sample of SNe Ia with insignificant reddenings of host galaxies [e.g., E(B-V)_host_{<~}0.06 mag], the scatter drops further to only 0.07 mag (or 3%-4% in distance), which is comparable to observational accuracies and is better than other calibrations for SNe Ia. This would impact observational and theoretical studies of SNe Ia and cosmological scales and parameters. ...\n",
       "We have analyzed the magnetic effects that may occur in rapidly rotating core collapse supernovae. We consider effects from both magnetic turbulence and the formation of magnetic bubbles. For magnetic turbulence we have made a perturbative analysis for our spherically symmetric, core-collapse supernova model that incorporates the buildup of magnetic field energy in the matter accreting onto the proto-neutron star shortly after collapse and bounce. This significantly modifies the pressure profile and increases the heating of the material above the proto-neutron star resulting in an explosion even in rotating stars that would not explode otherwise. Regarding magnetic bubbles, we show that a model with an initial uniform magnetic field ~10^8^ G and uniform angular velocity of ~0.1 rad/s can form magnetic bubbles due to the very nonhomologous nature of the collapse. It is estimated that the buoyancy of the bubbles causes matter in the proto-neutron star to rise, carrying neutrino-rich material to the neutron star surface. This increases the neutrino luminosity sufficiently at early times to achieve a successful neutrino-driven explosion. Both magnetic mechanisms thus provide new means for initiating a Type II core-collapse supernova. ...\n",

This has achieved an 80,000-fold improvement in sensitivity relative to earlier surveys. 2MASS used two highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope was equipped with a three-channel camera, each channel consisting of a 256x256 array of HgCdTe detectors, capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J (1.25 microns), H (1.65 microns), and Ks (2.17 microns). The University of Massachusetts (UMass) was responsible for the overall management of the project, and for developing the infrared cameras and on-site computing systems at both facilities.

AKARI was developed by the members of JAXA/ISAS and collaborators. IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite, launched in 1983 by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands) carried out the first all-sky survey at infrared wavelengths and made a huge impact on astronomy. The AKARI mission was an ambitious plan to make an all-sky survey with much better sensitivity, spatial resolution and wider wavelength coverage than those of IRAS. All-sky survey obtained by the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard the AKARI satellite, at 65um (Color), 90 um (WIDE-S), 140um (WIDE-L),and 160um (N160).
